# üìö Library Management System (Python)

Author : M.S.MEYSINTHA

A Python-based project to manage books, users, and library operations.
This project simulates how a library works, with features like adding books, borrowing, returning, and displaying available books.
It is beginner-friendly and helps understand concepts of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in Python.

# üìå Features

‚úÖ Add Books ‚Äì Add new books to the library‚Äôs collection
‚úÖ Display Books ‚Äì View all available books in the library
‚úÖ Borrow Books ‚Äì Issue books to users if available
‚úÖ Return Books ‚Äì Return borrowed books back to the library
‚úÖ Looped Menu ‚Äì User can perform multiple operations until they exit

# üìú Code Example
class Library:
    def __init__(self, books):
        self.books = books

    def display_books(self):
        print("\nAvailable Books:")
        for book in self.books:
            print(" -", book)

    def borrow_book(self, book_name):
        if book_name in self.books:
            self.books.remove(book_name)
            print(f"You have borrowed '{book_name}'. Please return it on time.")
        else:
            print("Sorry, this book is not available.")

    def return_book(self, book_name):
        self.books.append(book_name)
        print(f"Thank you for returning '{book_name}'.")


library = Library(["Python Basics", "Data Structures", "AI with Python", "Cyber Security"])

while True:
    print("\n=== Library Menu ===")
    print("1. Display Books\n2. Borrow Book\n3. Return Book\n4. Exit")
    choice = int(input("Enter choice: "))

    if choice == 1:
        library.display_books()
    elif choice == 2:
        book = input("Enter book name to borrow: ")
        library.borrow_book(book)
    elif choice == 3:
        book = input("Enter book name to return: ")
        library.return_book(book)
    elif choice == 4:
        print("Thanks for using the Library Management System!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Try again.")

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Run
=== Library Menu ===
1. Display Books
2. Borrow Book
3. Return Book
4. Exit
Enter choice: 1

Available Books:
 - Python Basics
 - Data Structures
 - AI with Python
 - Cyber Security

Enter choice: 2
Enter book name to borrow: Python Basics
You have borrowed 'Python Basics'. Please return it on time.

# ‚ö° How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system


# Run the program:

python library.py

# output



# üöÄ Future Improvements

Add user accounts with login system

Track which user borrowed which book

Store data in text files or database (SQLite/MySQL)

Add fine system for late returns

Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
